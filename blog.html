<p class="para">My first steps on Canadian land was in June/July 2011, I was about seven-years-old. As a seven Y.O. you love the parks, you can freely run around like a mad man. In Toronto, Ontario there's two amazing, beautiful parks: High Park and Queens Park. Really loved them, especially Queens Park, we used to the subway to get there.</p>
<p class="para">One of the best waterparks in the world is <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/niagara" class="TGWL">TheGreatWolfLodge</a>, to this day, I wouldn't mind being there for more than a few days. I don't want to stay for too long so I don't lose the dream of being there. It's in Niagara, I believe it's near the Niagarafalls.</p>
<p class="para">One of the best universities in North America is the University of Toronto, which locates in Toronto, Ontario. Which both my parents studied there. My father went to Canada to study to better his Med. degree/position. My mother saw an opportunity to study the language. Including the school my sister and I studied in was amazing, respectful, and had great people.
</p>
<p class="para">God where do I start with the shopping? North America in general is the best when it comes to shopping. Their prices are cheap compared to Europe and other places in the world. Everytime my family and I visit Canada we come back with new cloths and our old cloths are back in Canada. Obviously its a joke, I'm just making a point(laughing face).</p>
<p class="para">The resorts are amazing and wonderful. TheGreatWolfLodge is a resort. And personally I don't rememeber being to any other resorts, but nevertheless Canada has a lot of amazing resorts-so I have heard(laughing face). Seriously though, Canada isn't only about the places you can visit, the people are really nice and friendly. I truely recommend visiting Canada. </p>
